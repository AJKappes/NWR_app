#### Nutrient Recycling and Diversion of Waste to Energy 

Anaerobic digestion (AD) produces biogas from various agricultural and industrial inputs while also serving as a sustainable waste management system. This project models AD production from input sets and creates a user-friendly web application for evaluation of AD production scenarios. 

Producers gain increased efficiency of AD use when being able to evaluate different production scenarios based on varying inputs. Policy-makers also benefit from improved understanding of AD use as a sustainable waste management practice, as well as its production of renewable energy, and can better design and support policies that promote AD adoption.

Specifically, this [*model*](https://nwrapp.herokuapp.com/nwr_app/) computes AD phosphorus output intended for crop application and gives a application recommendation based on current soil test values, and also computes total revenue generated from tipping fees and approximates energy production in kilowatt hours from input biogas potential conversions.
