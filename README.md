#### Nutrient Recycling and Diversion of Waste to Energy

Anaerobic digestion (AD) produces biogas from various agricultural and industrial inputs while also serving as a sustainable waste management system. This project models AD production from input sets and creates a user-friendly web application for evaluation of AD production scenarios. 

Producers gain increased efficiency of AD use when being able to evaluate different production scenarios based on varying inputs. Policy makers also benefit from improved understanding of AD use as a sustainable waste management practice, as well as its production of renewable energy, and can better design and support policies that promote AD adoption.
